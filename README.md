# 🌾 Farm Advisor – AI-Based Crop & Field Analysis System

![Farm Advisor UI](./farm-advisor-ui.jpeg)

Farm Advisor is an **AI-powered smart farming application** that allows farmers to upload crop or field images and receive **instant AI-driven insights, analysis, and advisory recommendations**.

The system uses a **Hugging Face pre-trained model** for image analysis, with a **FastAPI backend** and a modern **React frontend**.

## 📌 About the Project

Traditional farming decisions often rely on experience and guesswork, which may lead to crop loss and reduced productivity.  
**Farm Advisor** leverages **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision** to help farmers make **data-driven decisions** using simple image uploads.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze crop or field images using AI
- Provide smart insights and recommendations
- Assist farmers with early detection of issues
- Improve agricultural productivity using technology

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📷 Upload crop or field images
* 🧠 AI-powered image analysis
* 🌱 Crop health & advisory insights
* ⚡ Fast response using Hugging Face Inference API
* 🎨 Clean and farmer-friendly UI
* 🐳 Dockerized frontend & backend

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a crop/field image from the UI  
2. React frontend sends the image to FastAPI backend  
3. Backend calls **Hugging Face Inference API**  
4. AI model analyzes the image  
5. Prediction & insights are returned  
6. Results are displayed on the dashboard

## 🤖 Hugging Face Model Integration

The backend uses a **Hugging Face hosted pre-trained model** for image analysis.

### API Flow


### Sample Backend Code
     python
           
    import requests
    API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/<your-model-name>"
    #headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN"
    }

    def analyze_image(image_bytes):
      response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, data=image_bytes)
      return response.json()
